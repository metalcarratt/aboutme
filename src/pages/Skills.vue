        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <h3>Non-technical skills</h3>
        <h4>Coaching and mentoring</h4>
        <p>
            I have been involved in monthly one-on-one coffee catch-ups with a number
            of colleagues to help progress career development and opportunities and to
            gauge employee happiness within our team.  have also had a lot of experience
            mentoring other developers, working through problems together, and teaching
            testers how to write code. I conducted a series of teaching classes to teach
            testers coding and was involved in writing code challenges for some friendly
            competition among developers. I also ran a number of sessions to train junior
            developers in my team on common technical web development skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of becoming a Technical Lead, I attended a small team leadership course.
        </p>

        <h4>Agile and presentation</h4>
        <p>
            Our team went on agile training together and learned how to practice scrum
            together over a number of years. I learned how to work with the client to
            achieve a goal, elicit requirements, estimate effort and present results.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also been on a presentation course, and have presented in front of
            various audiences including my own team and representatives from the client.
        </p>

        <h4>Team morale</h4>
        <p>
            I initiated a number of projects to improve team cohesion and morale, such
            as facilitating retrospectives, running team-building games, and running a
            photo-editing competition.
        </p>
        


        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <h4>Java</h4>
        <p>
            I have more than eight years experience working in Java on large-scale
            enterprise products, including RealMe and the Ministry of Justice’s Case
            Management System used in NZ Courts. I am well versed in all aspects of
            the stack, including frontend, API, webservices, database and builds
            using maven.

        </ul>

        <h4>UI/UX</h4>
        <p>
            I have a keen interest in UI and UX design and had the opportunity to
            design the user interface for a recent project. I have undergone a 52-week
            online course in UI and UX and wrote a short internal whitepaper on how UX
            and security can complement each other.
        </p>

        <h4>Frontend</h4>
        <p>
            Most of my development experience is in building web applications, and I am
            fluent in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. More recently I worked on a large-scale
            Vue.js application for over a year, which is the replacement for the system
            used to record cases in NZ courts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I am working on a project for Stuff Ltd, using Angular.js.

        <p>
            I have a lot of experience writing integration tests using variations of
            Selenium (a custom built framework and also Serenity). I have also developed
            tests using Mockito and Powermock in JUnit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was part of an effort in my team to train testers how to write code so that
            they could better support the development and maintenance of our test automation
            suite.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h4>Servers and OS</h4>
        <p>
            All the applications I have worked on were deployed to Linux environments, therefore
            I have a lot of experience using Linux for installation, searching log files,
            configuring servers, debugging network issues, and so on. I have used a wide range
            of Java application servers including JBoss (Wildfly) and Weblogic. I’ve also used
            Tomcat and Apache.

            <skillLow>Weblogic</skillLow>
        </ul>

        <h4>Databases</h4>
        <p>
            I have worked on a range of Sql databases including MySql, Oracle, Postgres
            and h2. I am by no means a Sql guru, but I have a lot of experience writing
            complex search queries and configuring stored procedures and have dabbled in
            query optimisation.

        </ul>

        <h4>CI/CD</h4>
        <p>
            I have used both subversion and git over the years. I have used various git
            repositories services such as GitLab, GitHub and BitBucket. I have also installed
            a local GitLab instance and have experience configuring CI/CD pipelines in
            GitLab.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have experience using Jenkins, Nexus and Archiva, and also installed a
            local Nexus instance for our team.

        <p>
            I have experience using and configuring Vagrant on VirtualBox and writing ansible
            scripts for local developer environment provisioning. More recently I am learning
            to use Docker.

        </ul>

        <h4>Products</h4>
        <p>
            I have quite a few years experience working on Forgerock products, including OpenAM
            and OpenDJ. We used OpenAM for a complex business case, which involved writing a lot
            of plug-ins.
