        <h4>RealMe</h4>
        <p>
            I spent about six years working on all aspects
            of <a href="https://www.realme.govt.nz/" target="_blank">RealMe</a>,
            from frontend to backend. This is a Java application with a JSF frontend.
        </p>

        <h4>CMS and UCiC</h4>
        <p>
            I spent over two years working on the Ministry of Justice Case Management System (CMS).
            CMS itself is on a private network so cannot be viewed. This is a Java application
            with a JSP frontend.
        </p>

        <p>
            I led the re-build of the Update Case in Court (UCiC) application, which is a
            Java application with a Vue.js frontend. I also designed the re-skin for UCiC.
            Unfortunately, for contract reasons, I cannot provide any examples of this.

        <h4>Security and UX - whitepaper</h4>
        <p>
            I wrote a short whitepaper in 2016 about the dependence of UX on security. You can view it
            here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gvR6An6jZ5zk5pPOlOzQ2Mw8Lmbdza61/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Security and UX</a>
