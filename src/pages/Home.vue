        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Technical Lead working the last eight years at <a href="https://datacom.com/nz/en" target="_blank">Datacom NZ</a>. While there I have
            progressed from Junior Java Developer to Technical Lead. While I am a developer at
            core I enjoy getting involved in many other aspects of my work, such as engagement
            with customers, training and mentoring, and working on technical design. My main
            experience is with large scale full stack Java applications, but I have a particular
            interest in UI/UX design and frontend Javascript development. I like teaching and
            helping teams bring out their best potential.
